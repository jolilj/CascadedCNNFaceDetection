# Face Detection Using Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks
A simple cascaded convolutional neural network for single face detection implemented in python using [Keras](https://keras.io). Due to the computationally heavy nature of deep networks a shallow initial net, 24Net, is implemented for fast discrimination of the sub-images generated by a sliding window together with an image pyramid. This allows for a small portion of the input data to be passed to the deeper 48Net for final detection. The architecture enables computationally efficient detections with an accuracy of 88%.

## Installation
To run the code you need Python 2 and [Keras](https://keras.io) installed and a dataset. We used [FDDB](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/).

## Usage
Code entry point is [main.py](https://github.com/jolilj/CascadedCNNFaceDetection/blob/master/python/main.py). Read project_report.pdf for a thorough review of the method.
